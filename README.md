# image_generator
MERN web app that uses the OpenAI API in order to create images based on a text prompt.

Considering the recent advance in technologies that use language transformer models, I thought of making a site that incorporates this technology using the OpenAI API to generate different kinds of images based on user prompts.

I shall add that this is my first MERN stack project and I'm glad I succeeded in creating a website similar to a social media platform with the use of backend technologies like Node and MongoDB.
